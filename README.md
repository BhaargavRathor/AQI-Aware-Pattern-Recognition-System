# AQI AWARE PATTERN RECOGNITION SYSTEM


## Symptom Detective Agent for Respiratory Health

This project presents an agentic system designed to identify patterns
between air quality trends (AQI) and respiratory symptom flare-ups.
The system reasons over delayed effects of pollution exposure and provides
explainable, non-clinical insights for awareness and self-management.

Rising air pollution levels in cities like Delhi and other Indian states
have led to a significant increase in respiratory issues. This system aims to
help users understand how worsening AQI may be contributing to their symptoms
over time.
